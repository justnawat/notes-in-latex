\chapter{Superposition and Standing Waves}

Similar to particles, we can combine multiple waves in a system
with boundary conditions. In this system, only certain frequencies
can exist and we say the frequencies are quantized. 

Also consider the combination of waves with different frequencies.
When two sound waves with similar frequency interfere, we notice 
variations in the loudness called \textit{beats}.

\section{Analysis Model: Waves in Interference}

Many waves in nature cannot be described by a single traveling wave, 
so we must analyze them as a combination of multiple waves. For this,
we can use the \textbf{superposition principle}: \textit{If two or
more traveling waves are moving through a medium, the resulting
wave is the value of the wave function at any point is the algebraic
sum of the values of the wave functions of the individual waves}.
Waves that follow this principle are called \textbf{linear waves}.
